I rode all night from tropical Veracruz through tunnels and the cold mountain passes to Mexico City. At first light, I spotted a tiny figure seated 3 hopper cars ahead. I jogged forward and leaped from car to car to reach him before we were enveloped in fog. I squeezed off a few horizontal and vertical frames. I got one step closer, about to ask his name when I saw he was shivering and sobbing. My empathy as a parent pulled me back from a private moment I felt should be his alone. The anonymous, underdressed boy in a dirty shirt never noticed me on his sojourn to El Norte somewhere on the invisible horizon.” – Don Bartletti",
